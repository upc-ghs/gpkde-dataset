## Benchmark timeseries 2D
Log files employed for the comparison of runtimes of a Random Walk Particle Tracking (RWPT) simulator, while considering a timeseries run with NT=100 snapshots, with and without [GPKDE](https://github.com/upc-ghs/gpkde.git) reconstruction of concentrations.

RWPT simulations were performed on an Intel® Core™ i7-9700 CPU @ 3.00GHz processor.

### Folders
- ```logfiles``` : the source log files containing the information from the RWPT simulation (number of particles, runtimes, etc.).

### Files
- ```get_data.py``` : read the log files generated by the particle simulator and generate a consolidated file with the information for benchmarking ```data.csv```
- ```figure_timeseries.py```: reads ```data.csv``` and generates the figure for the comparison of runtimes between models with and without the smoothed reconstruction of concentrations.
