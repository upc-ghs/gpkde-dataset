## Benchmark errors 1D
Compute the error of reconstruction versus the analytical 1D normal distribution. Reconstruction considers 10 realizations of a stochastic selection of particle coordinates, with a prescribed bin size, or with methodologies for automatic bin size selection. 

### Folders
- ```gpkderuns``` : folder containing the [GPKDE](https://github.com/upc-ghs/gpkde) reconstruction runs, for different number of particles. Each folder contains the reconstruction files considering different bin sizes, and methodologies with automatic bin selection. The source files containing the then realizations of the stochastic particle coordinates selection are also included in each folder. 

### Files
- ```postprocess.py``` : read the log and output files generated by [GPKDE](https://github.com/upc-ghs/gpkde) runs considering a given bin size. Computes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) versus the analytical normal distribution. Data is consolidated into the ```databins.csv``` file.
- ```postprocessautobin.py``` : Similar to the previous file, but postprocess specifically the data files considering automatic bin size selection with Scott's (```scott```) and Freedman-Diaconis (```fd```) rules. Data is consolidated into the ```dataautobin.csv``` file.
- ```figure_error.py```: reads ```databins.csv``` and ```dataautobin.csv``` to generate a figure of the RMSE errors.
